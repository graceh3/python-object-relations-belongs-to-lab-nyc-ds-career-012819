    "We have worked with many classes and domains that all seem to be related in some way. That is the point of a domain model after all, right? So, we know that our classes and domain models should mirror real world structures for our programs to operate the way we want them to. Another concept to accomplish this is Object Relationships. Don't worry, these relationships will be a lot less complex than our real world relationships -- hopefully. Basically, object relationships attempt to show how one object relates with another in a given environment or domain. So, let's take for example a `Person` class and a `Dog` class. A person could have one or many dogs and since dogs are notoriously loyal, a dog has one owner. In an object relationship this would mean that a dog *belongs to* a person. Below, we are going to practice translating this type of relationship into code."

    "## Defining Our Class\n",
    "Alright, we are going to use a Car class to demonstrate a \"belongs to\" relationship. So, to get started, let's define a Car class with an `__init__` method that takes in parameters for make, model, year, and owner. The make and model are will be strings representing the name of the car manufacturer and the name of the car model, the year will be a number representing the year the car was produced, and the owner will be a string with the name of the car's owner. Again, these instance variables should follow convention and use leading underscores. Let's make intance methods to both get and set (read and write) these instance variables. Use the appropriate decorators and call these methods `make`, `model`, `year`, and `owner`. We should also have a class variable `_all` which points to a list of all car instance objects and a class method called `all` that allows us to get (read) this class variable. "

    "Great work! In this lab we successfully created a belongs to relationship between different Python classes. We were able to create a domain that more closely resembles a real world structure by translating the real world relationship between cars and people into code. We were then able to leverage this relationship in order to query information about our classes and their instances. Object relationships, although more straight forward than relationships between living people, can get quite complex and it is important to think critically about how to set them up properly. In a belongs to relationship, we learned it is the responsibilty of the *belongs to* class (the Car class) to know what it belongs to. "
